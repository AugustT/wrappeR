\title{\code{createRoster} - Specify how to filter the occupancy model outputs.}
\usage{
createRoster(
  index,
  modPath = "/data-s3/occmods/",
  metaPath,
  ver = "most_recent",
  group,
  indicator,
  region,
  nSamps = 999,
  minObs = 50,
  scaleObs = "global",
  write,
  outPath,
  speciesToKeep = NA,
  clipBy = "group",
  t0,
  tn
)
}
\arguments{
\item{index}{Numeric. Index of the number of taxonomic groups to 
\code{applyFilters} across.}

\item{modPath}{A character string or vector of strings. Location(s) of the 
occupancy model outputs.}

\item{metaPath}{A character string or vector of strings. Location(s) of the 
occupancy model metadata.}

\item{ver}{A character string or vector of strings. Which set of occupancy 
model outputs to use? Can be manually specified e.g. Charlie's 
are "2017_Charlie"; or to source the most recent model versions 
use "most_recent" (default), which uses model metadata stored at 
"/data-s3/most_recent_meta" to identify the most recent model 
version per taxonomic group.}

\item{group}{A character string or vector of strings. Taxonomic group(s), e.g. "Ants"}

\item{indicator}{A character string or vector of strings. Whether or not to 
subset species and, if so, based on what. Options are: 
"priority" for priority species; "pollinators" for 
pollinators; and all to return all species in the group.}

\item{region}{A character string or vector of strings. One of "UK", "GB", 
"ENGLAND", "WALES", "SCOTLAND", or "NORTHERN.IRELAND" per 
taxonomic group.}

\item{nSamps}{Numeric or numeric vector. Number of samples to extract from 
each species' posterior distribution.}

\item{minObs}{Numeric or numeric vector. 
Threshold number of observation below which a species is 
dropped from the sample.}

\item{scaleObs}{A character string or vector of strings.
At what scale to assess the number of observations? One of
"region" to assess the number of observations at the chosen
regional scale or "global" to assess the total number of 
observations for the species.}

\item{write}{Logical or logical vector. If TRUE then the outputs are 
written as a .rdata file to outPath.}

\item{outPath}{A character string or vector of strings. Location to store 
the outputs if write = TRUE.}

\item{speciesToKeep}{A character vector of strings. the names of species to
include, this is used in combination with 'indicator'. ONLY species on both
lists will be included on the output.}

\item{clipBy}{A character string or vector of strings. One of "species" or 
"group" indicating whether to clip outputs by the first and 
last years of data for each species or for the whole group, 
respectively.}
}
\value{
A list of 1-row dataframes containing all arguments needed for \code{applyFilters}. \code{applyFilters}
        can then be applied to this list to filter models outputs for different taxonomic groups, which may 
        come from different rounds (e.g. Charlie's or later), for different regions, etc.
}
\description{
This function can be used to specify the filters that will be applied to 
             the occupancy model outputs using \code{applyFilters}. It works by creating a list
             of 1-row dataframes with all the information needed for \code{applyFilters}. This list 
             is then applied to the applyFilters function later. Arguments should be provided
             as vectors of equal length, with each element in the vectors corresponding to one 
             call to \code{applyFilters}.
